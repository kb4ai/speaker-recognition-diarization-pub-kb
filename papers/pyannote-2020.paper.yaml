abstract: |
  We present pyannote.audio, an open-source toolkit written in Python
  for speaker diarization. Based on PyTorch machine learning framework,
  it provides a set of trainable end-to-end neural building blocks that
  can be combined and jointly optimized to build speaker diarization
  pipelines. We describe several of these modules (voice activity
  detection, speaker change detection, overlapped speech detection,
  speaker embedding) and demonstrate how they can be composed for
  multiple speaker diarization paradigms.
