abstract: |
  In this paper, we propose a new loss function called generalized end-to-end
  (GE2E) loss, which makes the training of speaker verification models more
  efficient than our previous tuple-based end-to-end (TE2E) loss function.
  Unlike TE2E, the GE2E loss function updates the network in a way that
  emphasizes examples that are difficult to verify at each step of the training
  process. Additionally, the GE2E loss does not require an initial stage of
  example selection. We show that the new loss function is more efficient and
  produces better speaker embedding vectors called d-vectors.
