abstract: |
  In this paper, we use data augmentation to improve performance of
  deep neural network (DNN) embeddings for speaker recognition.
  The embeddings are extracted from a DNN trained to discriminate
  between speakers using a softmax output layer. We refer to these
  embeddings as x-vectors. The x-vector DNN is trained on MFCC features.
