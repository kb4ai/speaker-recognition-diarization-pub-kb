abstract: |
  This paper proposes an end-to-end neural diarization method that
  handles a flexible number of speakers by introducing encoder-decoder
  based attractors (EDA). The attractors are generated from the encoded
  speech features and used to produce speaker-wise embeddings for each
  frame. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on CALLHOME and
  handles variable numbers of speakers without needing to pre-specify
  the number.
