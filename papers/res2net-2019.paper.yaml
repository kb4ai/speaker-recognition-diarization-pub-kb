abstract: |
  Representing features at multiple scales is of great importance for
  numerous vision tasks. Recent advances in backbone convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) continually demonstrate stronger multi-scale representation
  ability, achieving consistent performance gains on a wide range of
  applications. However, most existing methods represent multi-scale features
  in a layer-wise manner. In this paper, we propose a novel building block
  for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like
  connections within one single residual block.
