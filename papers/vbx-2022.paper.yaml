abstract: |
  This paper presents VBx, a Bayesian HMM-based clustering method for
  speaker diarization that operates on sequences of x-vector embeddings.
  The method uses variational Bayes inference to jointly estimate speaker
  models and segment assignments. VBx achieves state-of-the-art results
  across multiple standard diarization benchmarks including CALLHOME,
  AMI, and DIHARD.
