  In this paper, we propose several modifications to the standard TDNN
  architecture for speaker verification. These modifications improve
  speaker verification accuracy while preserving a compact model suitable
  for real-time applications. The modifications include (1) a 1-dimensional
  Res2Net module with skip connections, (2) a Squeeze-and-Excitation block,
  and (3) an attentive statistics pooling layer that combines self-attention
  with standard statistics pooling.
