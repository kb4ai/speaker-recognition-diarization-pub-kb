abstract: |
  This paper presents a new speaker verification system based on a
  front-end factor analysis approach. The system uses a single space
  called the total variability space to model both speaker and channel
  variability. Speaker verification is performed by extracting a
  low-dimensional feature vector called the identity vector (i-vector)
  from the total variability space. The i-vector approach provides
  state-of-the-art performance on NIST SRE evaluations.
