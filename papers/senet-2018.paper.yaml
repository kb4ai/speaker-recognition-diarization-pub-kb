abstract: |
  The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is
  the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative
  features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local
  receptive fields at each layer. We propose a novel architectural unit,
  which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively
  recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling
  interdependencies between channels.
