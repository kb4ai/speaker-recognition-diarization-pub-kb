# Archived Web Content

Web pages and documents archived for reference and traceability.

## Purpose

Web content can change or disappear. This directory preserves important
reference material with full provenance tracking.

## Archive Structure

Each archive is in a dated directory:

```

└── YYYY-MM-DD--descriptive-name/
    ├── SOURCE.yaml    # Provenance metadata
    ├── content.md     # Main content
    └── ...            # Additional files
```
