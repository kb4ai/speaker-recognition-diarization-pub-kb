name: "NVIDIA Sortformer"
provider: "NVIDIA"
ngc-url: "https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/sortformer_diar_4spk-v1"

model-type: "diarization-pipeline"
architecture: "Sortformer (Transformer-based)"

description: |
  Multi-scale speaker diarization model using dynamic scale weighting.
  Sortformer processes multiple temporal scales simultaneously and learns
  to weight them dynamically based on input characteristics. Achieves
  state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.

approach: "end-to-end"

key-innovations:
  - "Multi-scale temporal processing"
  - "Dynamic scale weighting mechanism"
  - "Sort-based speaker assignment"
  - "End-to-end trainable pipeline"

training:
  datasets:
    - "VoxCeleb"
    - "DIHARD III"
    - "AMI"
    - "Fisher"
  max-speakers: 4

  requires-token: false
  license: "Apache-2.0"
  commercial-use: true
  fine-tunable: true

requirements:
  min-gpu-memory: "8GB"
  input-sample-rate: 16000

  framework: "NVIDIA NeMo"

example-code: |
  import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr
  from nemo.collections.asr.models import ClusteringDiarizer

  # Load pretrained model
  diarizer_model = ClusteringDiarizer.from_pretrained(
      model_name="nvidia/sortformer_diar_4spk-v1"
  )

  # Configure input
  diarizer_model.diarize(
      audio_filepath="meeting.wav",
      num_speakers=None,  # Auto-detect
      max_num_speakers=4
  )

features:
  - "Multi-scale temporal analysis"
  - "Dynamic weighting of temporal scales"
  - "Handles up to 4 speakers"
  - "Competitive with pyannote on benchmarks"
  - "Integrated with NVIDIA NeMo ecosystem"

limitations:
  - "Maximum 4 speakers (model-specific)"
  - "Requires NVIDIA GPU"
  - "NeMo framework dependency"
