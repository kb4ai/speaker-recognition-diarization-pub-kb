# Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)

last-update: "2026-01-05"

name: "AHC"
full-name: "Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering"
category: "clustering"

year-introduced: 1967

mathematical-basis:
  - "Bottom-up hierarchical clustering"
  - "Distance metrics (cosine, euclidean)"
  - "Linkage criteria (average, complete, ward)"

input:
  type: "embedding"

output:
  type: "cluster-labels"

complexity:
  time: "O(n^3)"
  space: "O(n^2)"

implementations:
  - tool: "scipy"
    class-name: "scipy.cluster.hierarchy"
  - tool: "scikit-learn"
    class-name: "AgglomerativeClustering"
  - tool: "pyannote"
    repo-url: "https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio"

variants:
  - name: "BIC-based stopping"
    description: "Use Bayesian Information Criterion to determine number of clusters"
  - name: "Threshold-based"
    description: "Stop merging when distance exceeds threshold"

advantages:
  - "No need to specify number of clusters a priori"
  - "Produces hierarchical structure (dendrogram)"
  - "Works well with speaker embeddings"
  - "Simple to implement"

limitations:
  - "O(n^3) complexity can be slow for large datasets"
  - "Cannot undo merge decisions"
  - "Sensitive to distance threshold"
