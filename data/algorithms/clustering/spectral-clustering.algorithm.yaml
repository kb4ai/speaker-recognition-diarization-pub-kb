# Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization

last-update: "2026-01-05"

name: "Spectral Clustering"
category: "clustering"

mathematical-basis:
  - "Graph-based clustering"
  - "Affinity matrix construction"
  - "Eigenvalue analysis"
  - "K-means on eigenvectors"

input:
  type: "embedding"

output:
  type: "cluster-labels"

complexity:
  time: "O(n^3)"
  space: "O(n^2)"

implementations:
  - tool: "spectralcluster"
    class-name: "SpectralClusterer"
    repo-url: "https://github.com/wq2012/SpectralCluster"
  - tool: "scikit-learn"
    class-name: "SpectralClustering"

variants:
  - name: "Constrained spectral clustering"
    description: "Incorporates must-link and cannot-link constraints"
  - name: "Auto-tune spectral clustering"
    description: "Automatically determines number of speakers"

advantages:
  - "Graph-based, captures complex relationships"
  - "Can auto-determine number of clusters from eigenvalue gaps"
  - "Works well for speaker diarization"

limitations:
  - "Computationally expensive for large datasets"
  - "Requires affinity matrix construction"
