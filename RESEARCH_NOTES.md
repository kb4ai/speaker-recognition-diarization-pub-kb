# Research Notes Guide

This document explains the `ramblings/` directory and how to use it for research documentation.

## Purpose

The `ramblings/` directory is a scratchpad for:

* Initial research findings
* Tool comparisons and experiments
* Ideas for new entries
* Questions to investigate
* Notes that may later become formal entries

**Content here is informal and may be incomplete.** It's meant to capture thinking-in-progress.

## Naming Convention

```
ramblings/YYYY-MM-DD--descriptive-topic.md
```

Examples:

* `ramblings/2026-01-06--streaming-diarization-comparison.md`
* `ramblings/2026-01-07--ecapa-tdnn-hyperparameter-tuning.md`
* `ramblings/2026-01-08--pyannote-vs-nemo-benchmark.md`

## Template

```markdown
# [Topic Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Draft | In Progress | Complete
**Tags:** tag1, tag2, tag3

## Context

Why am I researching this? What question am I trying to answer?

## Findings

### Key Discovery 1

Details, code snippets, links...

### Key Discovery 2

...

## Questions

- [ ] Open question 1
- [ ] Open question 2

## Next Steps

- [ ] Action item 1
- [ ] Action item 2

## Sources

- [Link 1](url) - Brief description
- [Link 2](url) - Brief description

## Notes

Random thoughts, ideas, things to remember...
```

## When to Use Ramblings

### Good Uses

* Exploring a new tool before creating a formal entry
* Comparing multiple approaches to solve a problem
* Documenting failed experiments (failures teach too!)
* Capturing ideas during research sessions
* Recording questions to investigate later

### Not For

* Formal documentation (use `knowledge/` instead)
* Structured data (use YAML entries instead)
* Permanent records (use proper entries with sources)

## Workflow

### 1. Start Research Note

```bash
# Create dated note
touch "ramblings/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)--my-topic.md"
```

### 2. Capture Findings

Write freely. Don't worry about polish. Include:

* Code snippets that worked
* Commands you ran
* Links you found useful
* Observations and insights
* Questions that arose

### 3. Extract Formal Content

When research is complete, extract into proper entries:

* Tool insights → `data/tools/*.tool.yaml`
* Algorithm details → `data/algorithms/*.algorithm.yaml`
* Concepts learned → `knowledge/*.md`
* Paper summaries → `papers/*.paper.yaml`

### 4. Archive or Delete

Once content is formalized:

* Keep the rambling if it has additional context
* Delete if fully captured elsewhere
* Mark as `Status: Archived` if keeping for reference

## Example Rambling

```markdown
# Comparing Real-time Diarization Options

**Date:** 2026-01-06
**Status:** In Progress
**Tags:** streaming, diarization, latency

## Context

Need to find a real-time diarization solution for live meeting
transcription. Requirements:
- <500ms latency
- Works with pyannote embeddings
- Can handle 2-10 speakers

## Findings

### diart

Looks promising! Built on pyannote.

```python
from diart import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
```

Tested on sample meeting:
- Latency: ~300ms
- Accuracy: 15% DER (higher than offline)
- Memory: 2GB GPU

### Online NeMo

NVIDIA's approach uses sliding windows...

[continues...]

## Questions

- [ ] How does diart handle speaker count changes?
- [ ] What's the minimum segment length for reliable embedding?
- [ ] Can we use custom embeddings with diart?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Benchmark diart on AMI test set
- [ ] Try NeMo streaming pipeline
- [ ] Create tool entry for diart

## Auto-Generated Index

The `ramblings/README.md` is auto-generated by `make readme` and lists all notes with their dates and topics.

## Tips

### Keep Notes Atomic

One topic per file. Easy to find, easy to extract.

### Date Everything

Use the filename date. Add date stamps within for multi-session notes.

### Link to Sources

Even in informal notes, capture URLs. Future you will thank past you.

### Use Checkboxes

Track open questions and next steps with `- [ ]` checkboxes.

### Don't Over-Polish

Ramblings are meant to be rough. Spend polish time on formal content.
